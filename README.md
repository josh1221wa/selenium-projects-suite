## Projects

### 1. Data Entry Automation

This project scrapes data from Zillow listings and fills in the data in a google form by itself so that the data can be seen in a sheet format.

Beautiful Soup is used to extract the data based on the class selectors of the HTML tags and then Selenium is used to fill in the data in the google form.

### 3. Instagram Follower Bot

This project aims at opening an instagram user's page and following all of his/her followers. This is just so that the content feed on your account would be similar to people with similar interests. This also works for accounts with 2FA, it waits for them to complete the 2FA before continuing the automation.
